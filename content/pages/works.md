    subtitle: Our mission and how we deliver real cybersecurity experience.
    text: >
      Elysium Cyber was built to solve a real problem: aspiring cybersecurity professionals need experience, but no one will hire without it. Our internship-style model breaks that loop.

      You’ll work on real projects — like log enrichment, detection rule tuning, and compliance automation — under the guidance of an experienced engineer.

      It’s not a course. It’s real work, real mentorship, and real impact.
